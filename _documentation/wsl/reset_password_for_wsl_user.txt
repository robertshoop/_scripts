Perform the following to reset the password for a WSL user account:

1) Launch the respective WSL distribution, in this example we will use Debian
2) Open a PowerShell session
3) Use the following command without quotes "debian.exe config --default-user root"
4) Run debian.exe
5) Once inside the bash shell run the command cat /etc/passwd to list all the user accounts on the machine
5) Once you figure out which user password you wish to reset use the command "passwd USERNAME" Replace USERNAME with the account you wish to update the password on
6) Type the new password twice to update the password
7) Type exit to exit from the WSL sesson and go back to the PowerShell session
8) Use the command "debian.exe config --default-user USERNAME" without quotes. Replace USERNAME with the user the password was just reset on
9) Run debian.exe in the PowerShell window and try the command without quotes "echo "test text", enter the password for the user account and if everything is done correctly you should see a line of text that says test text
