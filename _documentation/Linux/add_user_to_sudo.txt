# Use this script to install the sudo package on a Debian 11 box and then grant a user sudo permissions:
# Run as root (if this is the first time running it) or a user with root / sudo permissions.

apt-get install sudo -y
/sbin/adduser username sudo

Now, log out and then log in with the same user.
Open a terminal and run sudo echo 'Hello, world!', enter your user password and that's it!
